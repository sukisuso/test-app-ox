# Test-App exercise by JesÃºs Juan Aguilar

# Version used to develop the app:
- Node -> v10.9.0
- MongoDB -> v3.4.17
- NPM -> v6.4.1

## Run the app: 
```
$ npm install
$ node app
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

## Build react website (is not necessary if you don't change anything)
```
$ npm run-script build
```

## Run tests 
```
$ NODE_ENV=test ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha test/
```

* You should remove the DDBB 'testapp_test' each time after run the script.
